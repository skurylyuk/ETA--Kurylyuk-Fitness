# Kurylyuk-Fitness - Exploratory Data Analysis 

# Abstract
The goal of this project was to use New York subway data to deliver a preliminary analysis for
my client. My client wanted to know where the perfect location in New York was for a fitness
studio. I worked with Turnstile Data from September 4 - October 2 to address their request.
After refining my raw data, I built a visual presentation to displace the top 3 perfable locations
based on ridership on various days of the week and times with peak movement. In addition, to
cleaning, exploring, and aggregating the MTA data, I applied my own analysis, future prediction
and recommendation for my client.
Design

A client wants to open a fitness studio in New York and reached out to see if I can utilize MTA
subway data to predict which proximal location is best for her studio. She would like to place her
studio as close to a station as possible. In addition, she would like to know the peak days and
times to schedule classes.

# Data
The MTA Dataset contains millions of data points collected weekly going back to May 5, 2010. I
originally began my project with 3 months of data. However due to changes in COVID
regulations and companies returning back to work, I reduced my data set to the 5 most recent
weeks to allow for a more accurate analysis. This consisted of 1,049,604 raw data points.
